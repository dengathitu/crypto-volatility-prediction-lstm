\# Cryptocurrency Volatility Prediction



This repository contains all the code, data, and documentation for my thesis:

\*\*"Predicting Cryptocurrency Prices in Near Real-time Using Deep Learning Models on Numerical Time-Series Data"\*\*



\## Research Question

How accurately can various deep learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, forecast short-term price volatility (e.g., 24-hour change) in major cryptocurrency markets using numerical time-series data, and which architecture demonstrates superior performance for simulated real-time applications?
